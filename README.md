# The Relationship between Psychological Aspects and BMI among Undergraduate Students of Faculty of Science and Technology, UKM

## 📖 Project Overview

This project investigates the bidirectional relationship between psychological aspects and Body Mass Index (BMI) among undergraduate students at the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).

Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the study examines how depression, anxiety, and stress relate to BMI, and whether BMI in turn influences these psychological factors. The project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between mental health and physical health in university students.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and characteristics of the data.
- To analyze the bidirectional relationship between psychological aspects (depression, anxiety, stress) and BMI.
- To examine the relationships among psychological variables using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

## 🎓 Significance of the Study

- Provides insight into mental and physical health integration among university students.
- Supports evidence-based university health policy planning.
- Contributes to academic literature on bidirectional SEM modeling in health studies.
- Aligns with SDG 3.4: Reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases and promoting mental health

## 🧠 Psychological Constructs Studied

- Depression (measured using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 – PHQ-9)
- Anxiety (measured using General Anxiety Disorder-7 – GAD-7)
- Stress (measured using Perceived Stress Scale-10 – PSS-10)

These constructs are measured using validated questionnaire items and modeled as latent variables in SEM.

## 🧪 Methodology

Data Type: Primary data (questionnaire-based)

Population: Undergraduate students of FST, UKM (Session 2024/2025)

Data Collection: Online survey (QR code & social media distribution)

Analysis Techniques:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

Statistical Approach: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE / Robust MLE)

## 📊 Key Findings

- Psychological aspects (depression, anxiety, stress) do not significantly influence BMI.
- BMI has a significant but weak and inverse effect on psychological aspects.
- Strong positive relationships exist among depression, anxiety, and stress.
- An increase in BMI is associated with a slight decrease in psychological distress levels.

These findings highlight the complex and non-linear nature of mental–physical health interactions among students.
